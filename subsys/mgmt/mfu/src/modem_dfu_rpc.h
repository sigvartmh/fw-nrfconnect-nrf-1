/* This library API can be used to do a full upgrade of the nrf91 modem firmware.
 * As of now, Feb 2020, there are four files of interest included in the modem firmware zip folder:
 *     #1 72B3D7C.ipc_dfu.signed_<version_number>.ihex
 *        This is the modem bootloader file, which is the first hex file you must give to the modem. The preceeding numbers 
 *        "72B3D7C" in the filename equivalents to the hex value of the root digest hash value the modem responds with after
 *        being put in DFU mode. The bootloader hex file is assumed contigous and less than one page in size (0x2000 byte).
 *        Note that programming the bootloader is slightly different from the other hex files, as the modem doesn't need an
 *        address describing where to put the data.
 *
 *     #2 firmware.update.image.segments.0.hex
 *        This file contains meta-info about the main firmware file, and is significantly smaller than the second segment.
 *        It acts as a key the modem uses to verify the chunks of firmware data in file #3. It must be programmed after
 *        the bootloader has been accepted.

 /*
 *
 *     #3 firmware.update.image.segments.1.hex
 *        The main firmware file. This hex file has multiple memory regions (contigous regions).
 *
 *     #4 firmware.update.image.digest.txt
 *        The digest file is a plain text file that describes a set of memory ranges in the modem, and the expected hash value
 *        of the content of these memory ranges. This is used post-upgrade to verify the modem memory contents, and is mostly
 *        useful in the case where a re-upload of the modem is possible without the use of the modem.
 *        
 *
 * About data representation:
 *        This library requires that any firmware/hex files are converted to a binary representation. When writing data to the
 *        modem one must supply:
 *            - a byte array of contigous data. 
 *            - a target address
 *            - the length of the array
 *        These values are passed using the struct 'modem_memory_chunk_t'.
 *
 *        The address describes where to put the first byte of the byte array (in the modem memory), and is found when parsing
 *        the hex file. Contigous data means that the bytes in the array belongs as a single uninterrupted sequence, i.e. a
 *        block of data in memory. This implies that if the hex files describes multiple regions of contigous data it must be
 *        fragmented to contigous blocks before programming. This is the case for firmware segment.1 (file #3). Moreover, some
 *        of the contigous data blocks are too large to be held in memory and needs to be broken down into a set of shorter byte
 *        arrays.
 *
 *        When programming firmware/bootloader, use repeated calls to the write function 'modem_write_firmware_chunk' or
 *        'modem_write_bootloader_chunk'.
 *
 *        Write process pseudocode for a hex file split into binary contigous blocks:
 *
 *            modem_start_transfer()
 *            modem_memory_chunk_t memory_chunk
 *            uint8_t buffer[200]
 *            memory_chunk.data = buffer
 *            for block in contigous_blocks
 *                bytes_read = 0
 *                while bytes_read < block.length 
 *                    n_bytes = read_block(from:  block, to: buffer, max_bytes: 200)
 *                    memory_chunk.target_address   = block.start_address + bytes_read
 *                    memory_chunk.data_len         = n_bytes
 *                    modem_write_firmware_chunk( &memory_chunk)
 *                    bytes_read  += n_bytes
 *            modem_end_transfer()            
 *        
 * 
 * How to perform a full modem firmware upgrade using this library in steps:
 *     1) Run the initialize function
 *        This function will configure the RAM and IPC to non-secure and set up the required IPC channels. Then the address of
 *        an RPC descriptor is written to GPMEM[0]. This descriptor gives the modem information about the API version to use,
 *        and the length and address of the communication buffer. The communication buffer is set to be a minimum of 1 page (2kB)
 *        plus the maximum overhead of the RPC protocol (16B / 4 x uint32).
 * 
 *        The init function takes a pointer to a digest_buffer_t struct. If successful, the root digest hash modem response is
 *        put into the buffer.
 *
 *     2) (Optional): Use the root digest hash that you obtained from the init function to verify you have the correct bootloader
 *        by comparing it to the hex filename (file #1).
 *
 *     3) Program the files in order:
 *            Bootloader  (file #1)
 *            segment0     (file #2)
 *            segment1    (file #3)
 *        
 *        (See note on data representation)
 *        For each file do:
 *            - Invoke the 'modem_start_transfer' function before writing data to the modem. In practice, this function does not
 *              communicate with the modem, it only resets variables used to load data into the RPC buffer.
 *            - Write the data by using either 'modem_write_bootloader_chunk' or 'modem_write_firmware_chunk'. These functions
 *              takes a pointer to a 'modem_memory_chunk_t' struct that holds a piece of contigous data and a target address.
 *              Note that the 'target_address' field of the struct is ignored when writing the bootloader.
 *            - Invoke modem_end_transfer to finalize the transfer. If this function returns MODEM_SUCCESS, the programming was
 *              successful.
 *        
 *     4) (Optional): Use the digest text file (file #4) to verify that the modem firmware is correct
 *        Use the 'modem_get_memory_hash' to get a 256-bit hash of a memory region. Compare the result with the number in the
 *        text file. Remember to convert the text file number to binary before comparing.
 *        
 *  About error handling:
 *        The library uses an internal state machine to check whether an action is permitted

 *
 *        MODEM_STATE_UNINITIALIZED
 *          The program is in an uninitialized state before calling the init function 'modem_dfu_rpc_init'. If the init function is
 *          successful, the state continues to MODEM_STATE_WAITING_FOR_BOOTLOADER.
 *
 *          If the the init function returns an error, we enter MODEM_STATE_BAD. This occurs if the modem does not signal the IPC
 *          within a timelimit after being put in DFU mode. Usually, this has only been the case if the shared RAM region or IPC has
 *          been configured with the wrong settings/permissions and should not happen.
 *
 *        MODEM_STATE_WAITING_FOR_BOOTLOADER
 *          After putting the modem in DFU mode, it expects to recieve a bootloader. Other actions such as program and verify will fail
 *          before the bootloader is programmed. If the programming is successful the modem is ready for RPC communication, i.e. we enter
 *          the MODEM_STATE_READY_FOR_IPC_COMMANDS state.
 *
 *          If corrupted data is input instead of a valid bootloader we go to MODEM_STATE_BAD. This can be either because the modem
 *          signaled a fault, or as a result of a response timeout.
 *          
 *        MODEM_STATE_READY_FOR_IPC_COMMANDS
 *          In this state, we can send requests to program a region of the modem flash, or ask for a hash of a memory range . However,
 *          this state has a hidden state, as you first need to program segment.0 (file #2) before you can program the rest of the firmware.
 *
 *          If the modem signals a fault or error, or fails to respons, we enter MODEM_STATE_BAD.
 *
 *        MODEM_STATE_BAD
 *          Some operation that was attempted with the modem failed, and usually the reason is unknown. The modem performs validation of the
 *          files we want to program, and can f.ex. signal an error because of firmware downgrade protection (not all versions have this).
 *          To get out of this state, re-initialize the modem using the init function. This will reset all your progress and you will have to
 *          go through all the steps again. Note that in some cases a when there is an unidentified problem, it can't be fixed by running 
 *          the init function such that a board reset might be necessary.
 *        
 *        You can also use the following function to get information about the modem state:
 *            - modem_state_t modem_get_state(void);
 *        
 *        Also, check the return value of the function calls to see if it was successful.
 *
 *        If the modem responds with IPC_DFU_RESP_UNKNOWN_CMD (0x5A000001ul), the modem could not interpret the RPC data and a fault
 *        indication flag is set. The modem can indicate a fault both through the RPC response field and by writing a value to GPMEM[1].
 *        If the modem responds with IPC_DFU_RESP_CMD_ERROR (0x5A000002ul), the modem have rejected the command. A few possible reasons for
 *        this are:
 *            - data block target address range is invalid (valid ranges are 0x6000...0xFFFF and 0x50000...0x27FFFF)
 *            - data block size is bigger than the shared memory area size
 *            - data block size is bigger than FLASH size 0x280000
 *            - data block target address is not aligned to FLASH page (0x2000 bytes)
 *            - metadata is invalid
 *            - data block integrity check failed
 *            - flash target block erase failed
 *            - flash target block write failed
 * 
 *        By design, the response of the modem is limited to make it harder for an attacker to get information from the device. Unfortunately,
 *        this means extra harm for the user. The only option for recovering the modem state provided in this API is to restart the DFU
 *        from scratch. 
 * 
 *   (Optional) Remove dependency on zephyr by using SysTick for timing:
 *      By default, the library uses zephyr's 'k_sleep', 'k_get_uptime' and 'k_uptime_delta' for timing, mainly for detecting when the
 *      communication with the modem has reached a timeout. If you want to drop zephyr as a dependency the Cortex-M33 SysTick timer can be
 *      used instead. If used, the API assumes it has exclusive access to the timer for the duration of the DFU operation, but it will not
 *      define an interrupt handler.
 *
 *      To enable SysTick usage define MODEM_DFU_RPC_USE_SYSTICK as a compile option. For example, if you are using CMake, append
 *      add_definitions(-DMODEM_DFU_RPC_USE_SYSTICK).
 *      
 *      If the TENMS calibration value in the SysTick->CALIB is unset (has value 0), a TENMS value is calculated
 *      using SystemCoreClock (CLKSOURCE in SysTick->CTRL is not checked). Keep in mind that there exist two SysTick timers, one for
 *      secure and one for non-secure (timer is banked between security states).
